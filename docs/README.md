## 🔍 Key Features

### Agent Execution Patterns

**Collaborative Agents**
- Work together on complex problems
- Shared state via Portia AI PlanRunState
- Human-in-the-loop clarifications
- Plan-based execution with role assignments

**Autonomous Agents**
- Execute independently in isolation
- Round-robin load balancing
- No state sharing between agents
- Retry logic with fresh context

**Continuous Agents**
- Long-running event processors
- Persistent state across restarts
- Dedicated RabbitMQ queues
- Incremental state updates

**Scheduled Agents**
- Time-based execution (cron/interval)
- Celery Beat integration
- Configurable timeouts
- Audit trail in StateManager

### Deployment Features

- **Service Dependencies**: Ordered startup (infrastructure → core → agents)
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints with 30-second intervals
- **DNS Discovery**: Service-to-service communication via container names
- **Volume Management**: Named volumes for persistence, bind mounts for config
- **Horizontal Scaling**: `docker-compose up --scale autonomous-agent-pool=3`
